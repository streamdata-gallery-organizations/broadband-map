description: This page is for developers. We built this site entirely off the APIs
  below and we want to share them with you. We have the goal of embodying the spirit
  of the Internet by delivering the National Broadband Map through simple open standards
  on which others could further innovate. The APIs (Application Programming Interface)
  below are provided so that you can further drive the data across the public and
  private sectors through your own applications. Our APIs are free for use by anyone.
